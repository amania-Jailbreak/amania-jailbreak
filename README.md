Developer of IOS-Apps and Windows Software

I'm a Japanese guy who mainly makes Windows software, though I occasionally make IOS apps.
also make Linux distri but only occasionally.
I'll post my work here from time to time, so please check it out.
I really like the IOS jailbreak and support the main developers!
